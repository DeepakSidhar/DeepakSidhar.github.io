<li>Evaluate and adapt platforms and systems, using processes such as code refactoring, to produce secure distributed system solutions.</li>
<li>Critically analyse and evaluate solutions produced.d.</li>
<li>Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.</li>
</ol>


## Development Team Project: Design Document
Assignment Brief
Select a case study for the group from those presented in the reading for this unit.
You are required to design and create a scenario using Python which models the activities associated with the networked devices in a Systems of Systems (SoS)
based on the examples provided. An SoS, in general terms, are characterised by several features, often represented by the acronym (ABCDE) - 
that is “Autonomy - each system is free and independent with its own purpose of operation; 
Belonging - systems function collaboratively to meet a common higher purpose; 
Connectivity - synergism is enabled by the highly dynamic distributed network; 
Diversity - the constituents are heterogeneous, self-sufficient systems that are open for enhancement by evolution and adaptation; 
Emerging - the cumulative actions and interactions between the constituents of an SoS give rise to the behaviours that can be attributed to the SoS as a whole.” (Boardman and Sauser, 2006).
Some examples of an SoS include an IoT network (as used in a smart home), 

Deliverable 1: Design Document
Create an Attack-Defence Tree (AD-Tree) that models the security vulnerabilities of a client, a hub or host 
(i.e the part that gathers data and makes decisions about the operation of the system) and the overall system, based on the case studies provided. 
The tree should display typical vulnerabilities and you should select a suitable domain to allow quantitative evaluation of security vulnerabilities.

## Development Team Project: Coding Output
Assignment Brief

Your team should then design and build a prototype system to investigate the selected problem – create a number of experiments to test the hypothesis, 
analyse your results and produce a summary paper that discusses the question, model, experiments, analysis and the conclusion.

As a minimum, you should create a prototype that demonstrates the operation of, and interaction between, a simulated device and a simulated controller. Both should be modelled in Python and should demonstrate code and techniques that address both the challenges of distributed computing, mitigate (some of) the vulnerabilities identified in your AD trees produced in part 1 of the assessment, as well as answer the question posed by your hypothesis.
