## Research proposal
Assignment Brief

The research proposal presentation fulfils the learning outcomes where you will evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for your chosen topic, including data analysis processes and so produce and evaluate critically a research proposal for your chosen topic. This can be based on the literature review topic you chose in Unit 1 or the topic of your capstone project for MSc Students (MSc students - Please see the BCS Project Requirements document on the Module Resources page and also the CyBOK Knowledge Base for those taking on Cyber Security Projects as your Cyber Security project should fall into one of these CyBOK Knowledge Areas, as well as meeting BCS requirements).

You are required to create an audio-narrated slide presentation and a transcript in which you will present the following sections. These sections are required in a standard research proposal for the Computing department. You are free to combine/merge sections, where appropriate and without detriment to the structure of your presentation. 

Project Title.
Significance/Contribution to the discipline/Research Problem.
Research Question.
Aims and Objectives.
Key literature related to the project.
Methodology/Development strategy/Research Design.
Ethical considerations and risk assessment (as part of your ethical approval application).
Description of artefact(s) that will be created (if applicable).
Timeline of proposed activities.
