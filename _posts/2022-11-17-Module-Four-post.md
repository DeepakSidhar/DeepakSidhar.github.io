</ol>


## Development Team Project: Design Document
Assignment Brief
You are required to develop an application that provides a secure repository for an organisation with domain-specific requirements. A domain refers to a group of users with similar application and hardware requirements. A domain may be characterised by having:   

periodic pressure on resources (CPU, storage, or the network).
interactive response requirements between request and reply.
substantial data download requirements.
Such requirements place specific demands on a systemâ€™s operations, and this influences the way that it should be operated and managed.

Domains that you should consider for the purpose of this assignment include


the Dutch Police Internet Forensics (Government of the Netherlands, n.d.).

You can read more about the computer requirements of these systems using the references given. You should choose a single domain to focus your development on, and your system should be tailored to the requirements of this domain. In all domains, a user will need to be able to upload, download and share data.

Application requirements: 

The agreed criteria for successful development are:

The solution should ensure that all privacy and security regulations are met, including those specified by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (ICO, n.d.).
Mechanisms should be deployed to minimise the attack surface of the solution. 
The organisation would like to see a monolithic version of the application because they have concerns about security, scalability and supportability, and they may wish to extend use to partner organisations on a worldwide basis.
Development conditions: Open-source libraries must be used in your development to ensure that the code may be run for its assessment.

Your full brief is to:

Create a comprehensive design proposal report, describing how you will meet the requirements, and the design and implementation of the solution.
You should create a working prototype of your design based on a monolithic approach.

## Development Team Project: Coding Output
Assignment Brief

Carrying on from the Full Brief provided above, this assignment focuses on the second deliverable, a practical development of your design. 

You should submit a fully tested set of code with all required libraries. Code should be well documented with in-line commentary.
You should supply evidence of execution, demonstrating how key aspects of your code work (via demos, screenshots and output captures.
You should include comprehensive evidence of testing including output from test tools (such as linters, etc.) demonstrating correct code, security and functional testing with any remediation activity documented as well.
You should submit a README file that documents how the application runs

## Collaborative Learning 

Select one of the coding weaknesses which have been identified by OWASP and create a flowchart of the steps which may have led to the weakness occurring.
Which UML models might you use to present the design of your proposed software, and why are they the most appropriate choice(s)?
